# Indirizzo

An [internet form](https://suosm.github.io/business/) for mobile devices you can use to add geolocated Openstreetmap notes about commercial activities.

## Notes type

Indirizzo preset is for reporting addresses recording the following fields: 

* business name
* business category
* street (optional),
* postcode (optional),
* city (optional),
* description (optional).

## Usage

After note is sent, you can catch it at [NotesReview](https://ent8r.github.io/NotesReview/) filtering for "AggiuntoEsercizio". Selecting note, just copy and paste OSM-ready tags in suggested editors (Level0 works best).
